# Multi-Router Static Routing Project (Cisco Packet Tracer)

A live network simulation project implemented in Cisco Packet Tracer, demonstrating static routing, subnetting, 
and remote device management using Telnet and SSH across multiple routers.

## 🔐 Device Access Credentials (Same for ALL Routers)
The following credentials are configured identically on every router for consistency and ease of management.
### 🔑 Enable Mode
   ```enable secret:
   khan
   ```
### Telnet and SSH Login
